# HIC_Imputation


The tool HIC Imputation was developed by Florian Molnar, Octavia-Andreea Ciora and Kim Le for the De novo Endophenotyping project under the supervision of Olga Lazareva. This project was created as part of the Systems Biomedicine lecture at the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics.

HIC Imputation uses Hi-C contact matrices as an input and performs imputation from low to high resolution data. On the imputed matrices is a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed which is the basis for the k-means clustering.
